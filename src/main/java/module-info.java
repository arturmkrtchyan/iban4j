/**
 * Defines the iban4j module, which provides functionality for
 * validating, generating, and working with International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs)
 * and Business Identifier Codes (BICs).
 *
 * <p>This module exports the core API package {@code org.iban4j}
 * to allow other modules to use its classes, such as {@code Iban}, {@code Bic},
 * and related exception types.
 *
 * <p>The module also opens the {@code org.iban4j} package,
 * primarily to allow for reflection-based operations by frameworks or tools
 * that might need to access non-public members for serialization,
 * dependency injection, or other advanced use cases,
 * particularly for classes within the module (e.g., custom serialization).
